Wow. Ok. So Week 4 came and went, and though I did many things, blogging was not one of them. For the sake of brevity, here is a round-up of the week that was crazy, cool, and exhausting.Deployed an app to Heroku. You can check it out here: photogur. It’s a bare bones photo app, like ‘90s rip-off of imgur. All puppies.Went to my first Meetup. From what I’ve been told, this industry runs on meetups. Ruby Lightning Talks hosted one at Bitmaker Labs, with talks on Rails 4.2.5′s cool new features (by Mina), a look at Processing.js and generative art (by Natalie), 500px’s migration from Rails 3 to Rails 4 (by Kevin), and a few examples of productive Sass in Bootstrap (by Christina).Sorry to all the coders out there for the pre-cleanup branching mess.Started branching and haven’t stopped. Before starting our first group project, Mina introduced us to branching in Git. If only all kinds of work had built-in version control, task isolation, and feature merging.Installed the FactoryGirl gem and learned ping-pong testing. I must say, I’m biased towards factories over fixtures, if only just because the gem is called FactoryGirl. We are all ladies! (And, yes, I understand that FactoryGirl has nothing to do with feminism.)Made cinnamon streusel coffeecake for Thursday’s coffee and code!Nifty websockets diagram at the Rails Girls TO meetupLearned more about ActionCable than I can understand at this point. And I went to my second meetup! Rails Girls TO hosted an event at Shopify, featuring a different Mina—Mina Smart. She spoke about the ActionCable and websockets feature in Rails 5. See her presentation here.Ventured into the world of Bootstrap, and ohmygoodness, you guys, it is amazing. Natalie helped me figure out how to install the Bootstrap Ruby gem, and stuff is already looking waaayyyyyyy better.
