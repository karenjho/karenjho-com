On the weekend, Frank and I started a project that seemed “fun” and “low-commitment” and a “nice way to spend time together.”Escher, you devil. Your water looks like bricks that look like windows (or stairs).We decided to start a 1,000-piece, black-and-white puzzle on the grey coffee table in our tv room. Maybe because we didn’t have enough arbitrary frustration in our lives. We eventually moved the puzzle to the dining table, and it has consumed my life before and after school. The puzzle and I have a love-hate relationship (all the love and all the hate are are mine, as puzzles have no feelings).Meanwhile, at Bitmaker we had an interesting tour yesterday and an insightful talk today. On Tuesday, Ella (student success coordinator) walked us over to the headquarters of Nulogy. It was my first time inside a development company. Shah, one of Nulogy’s developers, told us about the company’s culture, structure, people, and work. He took questions and gave us a tour of the open-plan space. There are no corner offices, not even for the senior management team—Nulogy’s flat hierarchy and high esteem for personal ownership are reinforced by the physical space.Shah patiently answering all our questions. He also gave us snacks, which is +10 points.Then today, Bryan, a Bitmaker grad and current apprentice (but soon-to-be developer) at Nulogy, talked to us about his coding journey. As a person with little-to-no coding experience, it was encouraging to hear Bryan’s story. He has an arts education, but always had an itch to learn code and make programs. I appreciated Bryan’s honesty about the difficulty of this journey: leaving behind a career and stability for a new venture and creativity. Bryan spoke candidly about how tough it can be to find a good developer job when you are a coding baby. To help us our time as a coding apprentices, Bryan also shared some wisdom from Apprenticeship Patterns by Dave Hoover. Choose to be the worst, so you can learn from others (much) better than you. As you learn, expose your ignorance! Admit what you don’t know. When you get tired of sucking at coding, give yourself a break by retreating into competence. Do something you’re good at, maybe an old Ruby project (like the damn rover assignment) or making delicious cheddar-thyme scones. Recognize that programming is a long road and you are only at the start.
