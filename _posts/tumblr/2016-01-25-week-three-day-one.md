We’re on Rails!Today we started working with the Ruby on Rails framework, which is essentially a system of conventions to build your web code. Rails is an open-source framework, so a lot of developers have contributed valuable code packages (called “gems”) that cut out a lot of the repetitive work it takes to set up a dynamic website.Mina called Rails an “opinionated framework” because it basically only works if you follow its rules. It will make a lot of decisions for you and save you a lot of work, but you need to buy into it. Not everyone wants to do things the Rails way, so it’s not for everyone.May this Viking and I have nothing in common at the end of the Bitmaker bootcamp.Before we started Week Three, Mina had strongly advised us to set aside any need to deeply and fully understand everything we would be doing in Rails, at least for the time being. There are quite a few of us in Team Gort (myself included) that want to know why, how, and seriously, whyyyyyyyyy. If something works, I want to know the mechanics and pathways behind it. “Magic” is not a sufficient answer.Coding in my coat and scarf because it was cold, son!This afternoon’s assignment definitely stretched my comfort with incomplete comprehension. I copied a lot of code, read the explanation, saw that it worked, and had to move on. It was hard. I want to know what those “helpers” do! Why did I refactor my code that way? How does it all work? I want to believe that we will have all these answers tomorrow. But I suspect we’ll be uncomfortable for a while.
