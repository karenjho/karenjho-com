We made it! It is the last day of the first week. Speaking for all of us in Team Gort, it’s been an intense five days. I’m proud of and amazed by all that we’ve learned. We have bonded over frustrating code and the intense experience of immersing yourself in something new for 8+ hours a day.Friday is when the Bitmaker crew heads over to YogaBe for de-stressing and a little fitness. It was my first time at a yoga studio, and only my second or third time doing yoga. The instructor led us through poses and exercises tailored for our coding-related stressors, including ones for carpal tunnel and tight hips. I loved the change of pace and scenery. Will definitely return next Friday.Every day this week has been rewarding and full of growth. Our time at Bitmaker has proven that the brain can adapt so incredibly, processing volumes of new information and applying it in increasingly complex ways. This high pace of learning comes at a cost, though. I feel physically and mentally spent. Investing so much at Bitmaker means I don’t have as much to give the other parts of my life.At our friends’ house tonight, I declined to check out the new laundry room with the rest of the group and quietly chilled with the dog, Moose. Bitmaker had told us ahead of time to “let [our] friends, family, and
significant others know that [we] are taking on a huge challenge.” And to “manage [our] commitments.”  But I guess I didn’t expect the fatigue to kick in so soon. With another eight weeks to go, I am grateful for friends and loved ones who understand, make space, and give their support no matter what. Thank you, all—you da best.If anyone has ideas or tips on how to manage through intense seasons in life, I would love to hear from you! Listening and talking to God through prayer are crucial for me. How do you cope, or better yet, thrive?
