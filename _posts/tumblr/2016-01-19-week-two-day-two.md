Today we learned about web servers! Did you know the World Wide Web is only a small part of the Internet? I didn’t. Mina didn’t explain what the rest of the Internet is, so instead you should see xkcd’s map of the Internet.A server has two jobs: 1) listen for requests, and 2) provide a response. A web server takes requests from users via a web browser (usually), and displays a response based on that request (again, usually to a web browser). We are starting on a Domain Specific Language called Sinatra, which is like baby Rails.We used Sinatra to get a very basic web server running. Of course, whenever we quit the program in our terminal, the web server would shut down. But we played around with grabbing information and sending the user around via the path (featuring one of my favourite animals).In the afternoon, Tara Mahoney, a graduate of the March 2015 cohort of Bitmaker’s web development program, came to talk about freelancing. She was honest and open about how difficult it can be to get a job with no development work experience. I especially appreciated her tips on the freelance hustle, particularly these points:Ask for half the money up front. If the client can’t/won’t pay half up front, chances are not great they’ll pay the full amount at the end.Project fees are your friend. Once you figure out how long it takes you to complete a standard piece of work (like a certain kind of webpage), multiply those hours by your hourly fee to get a project fee. Much easier for your customers to know how much they’ll be spending, and for you to know how much you’ll be making.Have confidence in your work. Tara said this, “Your work is valuable. You are not the chicken.” Related: “Don’t work with assholes.” Always reduce the amount of work you have to do. If you’ve written an awesome program that you can repeatedly use to deliver projects on the same platform to different clients, find a way to use that program! Or write code that you can use over and over again.You are not the chicken.Though I would love to get a job after the program is finished, freelancing could be a great way to hone my chops and to earn income while gaining experience. And, after Tara’s talk, freelancing seems a little less daunting and a little more viable.
