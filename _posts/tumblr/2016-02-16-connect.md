Last week at Bitmaker we learned JavaScript and jQuery, which I used to build a variation on tic-tac-toe, called Connect!Connect! builds a board sized to the height and width set by the players. Each click alternates between two players, star and heart. A player wins the game by filling one whole row, whole column, or whole diagonal.I’ll leave the laborious code-jockeying and logic problems for another post. This little game is a source of pride, even if nearly every game ends in a tie. Play Connect! hereAnd check out the GitHub repo here: noughts-crosses
