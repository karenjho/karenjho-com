It’s Friday, guys!Another week down. Team Gort persists. Week Two was full of web servers, HTML and CSS, setting up forms, saving data, and databases. It was also full of over-confidence that led to frustration.From Tuesday onwards, I was always half an assignment behind. Last week I was able to submit my assignments every day before leaving Bitmaker. This week I took my work home and still failed to complete it. Every afternoon, I caught up with the previous day’s work and fell behind again.Until today. Thankfully, today things started to jive. I understood my errors when they happened. My code worked on the first run. When I went to look for my data, it was there. When you start being ok with errors, you realise how helpful those errors are. Besides informing you of the current problem, errors point you towards the next step. They show you why and how you can change. That goes for little code errors, and life “errors,” too.Sorry—got a little philosophical there.Mina covered databases today, particularly SQL databases. (We learned about NoSQL databases as well, which are a new and interesting concept for me. NoSQL databases explain how some very high-traffic, high-volume sites and apps can work quickly without crashing.) We covered some basic SQL functions like CREATE, SELECT, UPDATE, etc. But we won’t really have to worry about those, because we’ll use Object-Relational Maps (ORMs). ORMs are in-between layers of translation and magic. They take your Ruby code and turn it into database functions.A subset of Team Gort: Lub, Dave, Carlos, Metturan, and Chris.Sometime after our weekly yoga session, when we were all feeling a little peckish, pizza showed up. Well, Erik (Bitmaker’s lead admissions officer) brought us pizza. The whole room interrupted in cheers and applause, like we were NASA and we had just successfully launched a manned shuttle to Mars. It was a welcome Friday treat, and I didn’t feel guilty at all about eating several slices of pizza instead of the yogurt I had the fridge. Yum.So what does next week hold? Well, it sounds like we will be getting on those Rails. That means another steep learning curve, which I now understand is just how it goes in this Bitmaker bootcamp.Happy coding, friends!
