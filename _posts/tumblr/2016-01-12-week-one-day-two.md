Snow has come to the city of Toronto! It is wet and slushy outside. Everyone has their hoods up and their boots on. Thankfully, coding is an indoor activity, so Team Gort is warm and cozy as the snow falls outside the window.We start the morning by diving into Ruby. In our program, we will primarily use Ruby (on Rails) for our back-end web development needs. Ruby is a programming language that is:high-level,interpreted, andobject-oriented.# Coding info alert! Skip the next few paragraphs if you aren’t interested in the ins and outs of programming languages.High-level languages are distinguished from low-level languages by their abstraction (from the hardware). Low-level languages tell specific hardware how to encode information (at the lowest-level, in binary code or 1′s and 0′s). Mid-level languages (like C) are closer to the hardware and are machine-specific, because they actually tell the hardware where to store information and how to store and retrieve it. High-level languages, like Ruby (which is written in C), are not machine-specific. They don’t care how the hardware works—only that it does.Interpreted languages run immediately, without the need for compiling the code. Because the code is being interpreted as it is run, interpreted languages are slower than compiled languages. But the feedback loop is also tighter with interpreted languages, because you can see right away how and if the code works.Object-oriented languages aim to model the real world in the virtual. This is accomplished through objects, which are made up of properties (things that describe the object) and methods (things that the object can do). In Ruby, everything is an object.Photo from colbertrally.com. If you’re in the US, you can also watch the original “truthiness” segment from The Colbert Report premiere in 2005.Mina also introduced the concepts of truthy-ness and falsey-ness in Ruby. For example, in Ruby:5 > 3 = true!5 = false # ! is Ruby’s way of denoting “not” or “opposite”!!5 = true # two !s make a double-negative!!5 is truthy because it is not technically an evaluative statement. But 5 exists, hence it is true (or truthy).I’m feeling proud of myself for being on top of my breakfast, lunch, and snacks today. Lunch today was a mason jar salad:To be honest, this is too much salad. I have made two more salads for tomorrow and the day after. I might have to scale them down (though, as I type this, I have powered through all the salad, plus my afternoon snack of yogurt and blueberries).Today’s assignments are all about Ruby. The last assignment of the day, based on the children’s game Fizz Buzz, is a repeat of a prep work assignment I completed before the program started. I remember struggling through the code blindly, eventually completing it successfully through trial and error. This time, however, I write the code confidently. It only takes two runs (and one error) to figure out the solution, and I actually understand the code I wrote and why!
