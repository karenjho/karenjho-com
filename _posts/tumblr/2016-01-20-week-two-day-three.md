You know the saying, “Perfection is the enemy of completion”? I got a solid refresher in that lesson today. We started converting our programs from ASCII art-filled, 80s-nostalgic terminal printouts to HTML pages, styled in beautiful CSS. And that’s when my desire for a “perfect” website seriously impaired my ability to finish the day’s assignment.In my quest to make the well-designed site of my dreams, I spent 1.5 hours looking for the right font and figuring out how to implement it with CSS on my site. Yeah. By the time I realised how much time I had wasted, it was 4pm. And then I proceeded to spend another two hours trying to configure my menu just so. By the time I left Bitmaker, I hadn’t made it much further than the page header.This seal knows how I feel.Though I still haven’t sorted out the CSS, I did learn a valuable lesson today: when you’re learning, don’t spin your wheels trying to do it right the first time. Learning entails many little “failures” on the road to knowledge. The more comfortable you are with those failures, the faster you’ll learn. And, hopefully—unlike me—you won’t spend three hours on a page header.
