Before jumping into the third day of Bitmaker adventures, let me tell you about last night’s Meet Your Makers event at the school.Some of us (i.e. not me) crushing it at foosball and ping pong. Biding our time after assignments and before Meet Your Makers.Meet Your Makers is a chance for the last Web Development and App Development cohorts to present their final projects to Bitmaker students, friends, and hiring partners. I was excited to see what the last cohort’s students had built using the skills and tools they learned in nine weeks. Suffice it to say, many of the projects were impressive. Over and over again, the presenters emphasized the amount of time, sweat, and coding that had gone into each project. Scary, but inspiring. I can’t wait to start turning ideas into real, live web apps!Today was the day that the free Bitmaker coffee stopped cutting it. I caved and got a cup from Starbucks. Not the greatest, and not financially sustainable ($2+ per day for nine weeks = $$$). I need to figure out a reliable and inexpensive coffee source, quick. Preferably with minimal work. If anyone has ideas, please let me know!Mina showed us some of his preferred settings and shortcuts in Atom. Then he kicked off a review of arrays and hashes in Ruby. It was a morning of lightbulb moment after lightbulb moment—all the things I didn’t understand about collections finally made sense. Best of all, Mina took us through the Ruby docs and how to read them. Seriously, his explanation alone is worth the price of admission. Trying to decipher the docs on my own had been incredibly frustrating. And now, all their secrets are unlocked! (Kinda. I still have to read and understand them).We also reviewed how to define a method, what makes a good method, and variable scope. I’m taking a few pages of notes every day even though we can always access a lesson’s recording. The act of writing down and re-reading the notes is helping me to remember and understand what Mina is teaching.For lunch today, I ate another mason jar salad. And 10 chicken nuggets from Burger King because they were only $1.99. My excuse: I was bonding with fellow Team Gort-ers!
