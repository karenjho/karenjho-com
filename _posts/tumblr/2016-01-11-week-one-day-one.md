Our first day as the January 2016 cohort of Bitmaker Labs’ web development immersion begins with introductions and Tim Horton’s coffee. Everyone is very friendly, and I’m definitely turning up my extraversion dial. A common theme emerges: we’re all here for a dramatic career (or life) change. We will be called Team Gort.After lunch, we jump into the first lesson. Mina, our lead instructor, takes us through the command line, showing us how to quickly navigate our computers with the keyboard. He also introduces a couple of awesome shortcut tools. My favourite is Spectacle, which makes it easy to size and position windows.We move on to learning git, by way of an interesting brief bio of Linus Torvalds. Torvalds is the creator of the Linux operating system and of git (because one cool invention isn’t enough). In the programming world, git is used to track changes to code, even with many collaborators. All changes, plus a total copy of the code, are stored by git. You’d think this process would create massive files, but no—they are elegantly concise. Wish I’d had something similar for all the Excel and PowerPoint file changes at work!Most programmers use GitHub to store, interact, and share their git files (called repositories, or “repos”). So we set up GitHub accounts, and learned to initiate git repos, add to them, and “commit” or publish changes to them. You can check out my GitHub account here: karenjho. (To be amused, you can read a short story my course-mates and I worked on. Also, copying a repository on GitHub is called “forking.” You can bet we all giggled every time forking was mentioned.)And so it begins. The next nine weeks are guaranteed to intense, fun, tough, and rewarding. Stay tuned for more updates (hopefully, frequently).
